# Data Visualization

## Prerequisites
<b>Any device with a web browser that has access to the internet.</b> Additional requirements may be added in the future if downloading the program is required, however at this time this is not required as part of beta testing.

## Website
Please visit the website here: https://henryrodgers.github.io to access the existing hosted content.

## Test Scenarios
Please look through the website, as linked below, to ensure all existing features are functioning correctly. There is not too much to test, however, please do test the one existing interactive feature, the mapping API. It should be centered on the International School when the website is first opened, and able to be moved to any location. Please test this by moving the website to an easily referencable test location. If this does not function correctly and easily, please email one of us or create an issue at the link below where Known Issues are currently held.

## Primary Modules:
* import api.java - test module, supplemented in website repository.
* index.md - this file produces the html code for the main page of the website.
* _config.yml - this file initialized the website in github and allows for hosting to occur automatically.
