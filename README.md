# Data Visualization
Our program will serve as a free and open-source website that allows users to upload data and choose a method of simple visualization.

## Prerequisites
<b>Any device with a web browser that has access to the internet.</b> Additional requirements may be added in the future if downloading the program is required, however at this time this is not required as part of beta testing.

## Website
Please visit the website here: https://henryrodgers.github.io to access the existing hosted content.

## Current Features
- Display Project Information on Hosted Website (using GitHub Pages)
- Navigate through 4 different pages (Home, About, Map, Table)
- Use map imported from Mapquest API
- View table including API metadata

## Primary Modules:
* import api.java - test module, supplemented in website repository.
* index.md - this file produces the html code for the main page of the website. Supplemented by about.md, map.md, and table.md, which are all individual pages in the html website.
* _config.yml - this file initialized the website in github and allows for hosting to occur automatically. It also establishes the theme for the website, which is imported from a free and open-source project in GitHub.
