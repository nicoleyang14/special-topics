* Click File > Clone Repository > URL

### Test Scenarios
Please look through the website, as linked below, to ensure all existing features are functioning correctly. There is not too much to test, however, please do test the one existing interactive feature, the mapping API. It should be centered on the International School when the website is first opened, and able to be moved to any location. Please test this by moving the website to an easily referencable test location. If this does not function correctly and easily, please email one of us or create an issue at the link below where Known Issues are currently held.
